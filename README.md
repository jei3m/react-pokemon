**React Pokemon**: A turn-based Pokemon game developed using React JS. This project was initially guided by the tutorial from [Jutsu Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxZBgPOuh0g), while I implemented support for 3 players per team.

## Features

- **React JS**: Utilizes the powerful front-end framework, React JS for its user interface.
- **Ant Design**: A modern UI framework compatible with React JS

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to experiment with and understand how React JS can be used to build interactive web applications, particularly focusing on state management, conditional logic, and function execution. Through this project, I aimed to explore the practical applications of these concepts in creating a turn-based Pokemon game, where state updates, decision-making, and game mechanics are dynamically managed.

## Installation

To get started with the Pogi Typings Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jei3m/react-pokemon.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-pokemon
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## Usage
Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173. From there, you can begin by selecting your team lineup. Once your team is set, the opponent's lineup will be automatically chosen randomly.
